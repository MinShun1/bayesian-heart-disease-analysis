# bayesian-predictive-modeling-heart-disease
This project applies Bayesian logistic regression to the UCI Heart Disease dataset, comparing models with uninformative priors against domain-informed (informative) priors. The goal is to evaluate how prior specification influences predictive performance, diagnostics, and model comparison metrics (DIC, WAIC).
